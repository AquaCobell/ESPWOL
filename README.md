# ESPWOL
## Wake Up Network Devices with an ESP
This program gives you a simple webinterface and the ability to send WOL Packets to different devices on your network and wake them up.

## What is working right now
Waking up devices via MAC is already possible. 

## PLANED TODO
* Save Devices in the interface and wake them up whenever you want them to wake up.
* Wake already saved devices up with ip.
* Finish README
